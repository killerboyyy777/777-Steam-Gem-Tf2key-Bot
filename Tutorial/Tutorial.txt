1)Install NodeJS from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2) Download & install Steam Desktop Authenticator here: https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamDesktopAuthenticator and scroll down to see the instructions!
	
1: Go to the SDA (Steam Desktop Authenticator) directory. If you have encryption disabled go to step 3.
2: Open SDA and hit "Manage Encryption". Fill in your encryption key and when asked to create a new one leave the text box blank. This will disable encryption.
3: Head over to the maFiles folder and open the file named after your accounts SteamID64.
4: Search the file for shared_secret:"XXXXXXXXXXXXXX=", instead of XXX it should have a code there, it always ends with =
5: Do the same for identity_secret, it will look similar.
6. Go to config (found in SETTINGS folder) and fill in your identity_secret & shared_secret
7. You're gonna need a Steam API Key. Get it here:  https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey (if it asks for a domain name, simply put in 127.0.0.1 or localhost)

(Alternative for Steps 2-5 is to just use ASF 2FA if u have already set it up for your Account, you can get the data from your ASF folder in [Botname].MAFILE.NEW
Find ASF here: https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm)

3) go to the SETTINGS folder, and right-click + edit config.js. Fill in all of the required fields (Take your time filling it all in and don't make mistakes, it's a very important step)

4) If you don't want to host your bot on a server, simply go to the text file named 'How to start the bot'

5) Once you're done go to the main directory and click on "start", or go to the text file named 'How to start the bot'
